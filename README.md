# How Demographics and Urbanization Affect EV Adoption in New York - A MADE Project

Electric Vehicles are an effective tool in the fight against climate change, but their adoption varies wildly between regions.

This project aims to identify the demographic factors that promote or hinder the adoption of EVs by conducting analysis on data from the State of New York.

For this, data from the Department of Motor Vehicles and the US Census Bureau is used.

It is processed by an ETL-Pipeline and analyzed using Correlation Analysis and Explorative Analysis with the help of Chloropeth Maps.
